[](以上内容每个网页的内容.md文件都需要才能被识别和渲染)
[](permalink：网页的后缀，这里是主页所以只需要/，如果是Members页就需要/memebers，与_data/navigation.yml内对应title的url对应)
[](title：网页内容的标题，相当于在下面内容前加“#Title”)
[](author_profile：是否显示左侧信息栏，默认为true)
[](redirect_from：使用的一些格式，这里默认是/about/和/about.html，对于其他网页可以使用/md/和/markdown.html，如果网页使用了html相关语法（比如一些html图片格式）需要再加上/html/（参考members.md）)


We are a research team mainly focus on the Evolutionary Computation, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Black Box Optimization and Meta Black Box Optimization. We belong to the Computational Intelligence Lab, School of Computer Science, South China University of Technology (SCUT).This is an energetic team including undergraduate students, master students and phd students. The student leader in this team is [Zeyuan Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jcy8wPgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), persuing his PhD degree at SCUT. Students in MetaEvo team are advised (in part advised) by [Prof. Yue-Jiao Gong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mi0Zu3IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). As a pure research-oriented technical team, we aim to develop the new generation of black-box-optimization concepts, algorithms, frameworks and benchmarks. The resulting research domain is commonly termed as Meta-Black-Box-Optimization (MetaBBO), which generally mitigates the labour-intensive development in low-level black-box optimization algorithms through meta-learning automated algorithm design rules at meta level. We believe works done by this team could promote the research edge of both Evolutionary Computation and Optimization.

### Some useful resources we prepared for you
1. To learn MetaBBO conceptually, we have prepared a [**related papers repo**](https://github.com/MetaEvo/Awesome-MetaBBO), which is maintained and updated regularly to trace latest works.
2. To develop and learn MetaBBO in practice, we have prepared a [**benchmarking platform**](https://github.com/MetaEvo/MetaBox), which now supports various optimization problem types and plentiful baselines. Enjoy!
3. For our already [**published works**](https://metaevo.github.io/publications/), we have opensourced their detailed implementations in [**MetaEvo's repositories**](https://github.com/orgs/MetaEvo/repositories) for the convenience of researchers with interests.
