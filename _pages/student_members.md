**Zechuan Huang** (Undergraduate, 2023 -) I am deeply interested in Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Large Language Models (LLMs). My academic and practical experiences have equipped me with robust technical abilities, including proficiency in meta-black-box optimization, evolutionary algorithms, prompt engineering, and supervised fine-tuning for LLM post-training. Beyond my learning at the Metaevolution lab, I completed a valuable internship at Vipshop as an NLP Algorithm Intern, where I focused on the post-training of large language models. I am currently researching the integration of LLMs and evolutionary algorithms.
In my free time, I enjoy reading books and comics, and I previously served as the president of the anime club. I also have a passion for video editing, graphic design, and gaming.
I am now seeking to apply my diverse skill set to new challenges in the tech industry or in an advanced research environment.

**Qianhao Zhu** (Master, 2025 - ) Hello, my name is ZHU QIANHAO. I am an enthusiastic person with a deep passion for table tennis and chess. I play table tennis quite often and have developed good skills over time. It's a sport that keeps me active and allows me to enjoy moments of competition and fun with friends. Besides, I find chess intriguing for its strategic depth and mental challenge. It teaches me patience, improves my concentration, and offers a great way to relax and engage my mind. These hobbies not only bring me joy but also help me stay balanced and focused in daily life. I believe in staying positive, learning continuously, and embracing challenges both on the table tennis table and the chessboard.
