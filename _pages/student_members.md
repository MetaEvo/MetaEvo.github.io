  <div class="profile-content">
    <strong>Zechuan Huang</strong> (Undergraduate, 2023 -) I am deeply interested in Reinforcement Learning, Evolutionary Algorithms, and Large Language Models (LLMs). My academic and practical experiences have equipped me with robust technical abilities, including proficiency in meta-black-box optimization, evolutionary algorithms, prompt engineering, and supervised fine-tuning for LLM post-training. Beyond my learning at the Metaevolution lab, I completed a valuable internship at Vipshop as an NLP Algorithm Intern, where I focused on the post-training of large language models. I am currently researching the integration of LLMs and evolutionary algorithms.
    In my free time, I enjoy reading books and comics, and I previously served as the president of the anime club. I also have a passion for video editing, graphic design, and gaming.
    I am now seeking to apply my diverse skill set to new challenges in the tech industry or in an advanced research environment.
